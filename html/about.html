        <h2>Problem Statement</h2>
        <p>Young Singaporeans are self-learners when it comes to the history and heritage of Singapore, and need more effective, experiential ways of learning about and engaging with their heritage. <br/> <br/> The current reliance on traditional classroom-based teaching approaches results in a diminished understanding of Singapore's heritage, which undermines their sense of identity, belonging, and well-being.</p>
        
        <h2> Solution </h2>
        <p> While reading more about the problem, I made 3 observations/common assumptions, which also served as hypotheses to guide the design of my solution:
           
            <ol>
                <li> Built heritage can serve as physical and experiential reminders of history, especially if accompanied by resources and information on their significance.</li>
                <br/><li> Repeated, bite-sized, accumulated experiences best strengthen knowledge and understanding (compared to standalone field trips).</li>
                <br/><li> Most young Singaporeans today also have access to a device (particularly smartphones). </li>
            </ol>
            
            <br/> Based on these hypotheses, I proposed that a mobile app could serve as a heritage companion for the everyday Singaporean youth.</p>

        <h2>Features</h2>
        <p> When location services are turned on, the app provides dynamic push notifications on areas, streets, and places of interest the user visits or passes by in their everyday lives. These push notifications will include snippets of history or interesting tidbits on the everyday places visited by users - for e.g., the history behind street names, significant events, cultural symbols. The app could also one day be able to crowdsource currently unrecorded stories, events, or memories from users to contribute to this heritage database. </p>
        
        <h2> This is a web app prototype of this mobile app solution.</h2>
        <p> Based on your location, it provides you with pop-ups on places near you and their histories. You can also explore more of Singapore's places and histories through an interactive map.
